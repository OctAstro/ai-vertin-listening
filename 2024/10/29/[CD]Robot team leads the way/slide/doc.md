After 18 matches over three rounds between Sept 26 and 29, the team brought home multiple accolades. They clinched gold as a member of the FIRST Global Winning Alliance alongside Moldova, Madagascar and the Cook Islands, the second consecutive year Team China has won the prize. They also won bronze in the Albert Einstein Award for FIRST Global International Excellence, and bronze in the FIRST Global Grand Challenge Award.

在9月26日至29日的三轮18场比赛中，该团队带回了多项荣誉。他们作为FIRST全球获胜联盟的成员，与摩尔多瓦、马达加斯加和库克群岛一起夺得金牌，这是中国队连续第二年赢得该奖项。他们还获得了阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦奖的铜牌，以及FIRST全球大奖的铜牌。

Hosted in a different country each year, and this year in its eighth iteration, the FIRST Global Challenge invites youth from around the world to represent their country or region. Each team programs and builds a robot to complete tasks related to a pressing global issue, such as climate change or energy production.

每年在不同国家举办的FIRST全球挑战赛，今年是第八届，邀请全球各地的青年代表他们的国家或地区。每个团队编程并建造一个机器人来完成与紧迫全球问题相关的任务，如气候变化或能源生产。

This year's theme was Feeding the Future, which tasked the competitors to design robots capable of simulating sustainable food production processes, and come up with technological solutions to improve global food security.

今年的主题是“喂养未来”，要求参赛者设计能够模拟可持续食品生产过程的机器人，并提出技术解决方案以改善全球食品安全。

---

"If we hope to protect the natural environment and reduce the pressure on food production, we must conserve food and develop more sustainable ways of crop cultivation," says Zhang Junshu, a 16-year-old student at the Beijing National Day School, and a member of the Chinese team.

“如果我们希望保护自然环境并减轻对食品生产的压力，我们必须节约粮食并开发更多可持续的农作物种植方式，”北京国家日校的16岁学生张俊舒说，他是中国队的一员。

---

Another member, 17-year-old Zhao Wenjin, from the High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China, believes that robotics has vast potential use in agriculture and livestock farming. "Robots can substantially increase both quantity and quality of food products, contributing to sustainable food production. Robotics and artificial intelligence technology can also play a crucial role in reducing waste," Zhao says.

另一位成员，来自中国人民大学附属中学的17岁赵文锦认为，机器人技术在农业和畜牧业中有着巨大的潜力。“机器人可以大幅增加食品的数量和质量，有助于可持续的食品生产。机器人和人工智能技术也可以在减少浪费方面发挥关键作用，”赵说。

The students designed a robot shaped like a 50-centimeter cube to complete the task. In the matches, the team was required to make their robot transport green balls, representing energy, and blue balls, representing water, into designated containers. When both were placed in the correct containers, they produced yellow balls representing food, which then had to be transported to another designated area to score points.

学生们设计了一个50厘米立方体形状的机器人来完成任务。在比赛中，团队需要让他们的机器人将绿色球（代表能源）和蓝色球（代表水）运输到指定的容器中。当两者都放入正确的容器时，它们会产生代表食物的黄色球，然后必须将其运输到另一个指定区域以得分。

---

Zhao says that the most impressive moment came in the final stage of each match, when the robots had to mount a balancing platform for bonus points. The more robots that successfully mounted, the higher the bonus points for both alliances, which means that collaboration was necessary if all robots were to balance on the platform successfully.

赵说，最令人印象深刻的时刻是在每场比赛的最后阶段，机器人需要登上一个平衡平台以获得额外的分数。成功登上平台的机器人越多，两个联盟的额外分数就越高，这意味着如果所有机器人都能成功登上平台，就需要合作。

---

"Before each match, we would discuss tactics and arrangements with our opponents. I remember that before the final match, our alliance and our opposing alliance cheered each other on, hoping that we could all successfully get onto the platform," Zhao says.

“在每场比赛之前，我们会与对手讨论战术和安排。我记得在决赛之前，我们的联盟和对手联盟互相加油，希望我们都能成功登上平台，”赵说。

---

These moments of teamwork and friendship beyond alliance lines prevailed throughout the competition. Before going to Greece, the team held online meetings with other teams, during which they introduced the Chinese food, art and famous historical sites.

这些超越联盟线的团队合作和友谊时刻在整个比赛中盛行。在去希腊之前，团队与其他团队举行了在线会议，在这些会议上他们介绍了中国的食物、艺术和著名的历史遗址。

---

"Our team designed badges and stickers with prints of pandas and other well-known animals. Before the competition, we communicated with other teams, and talked about China's landmarks and cultural heritage. The interactions were wonderful," Zhang says. "Every team brought their own personality and warmth. They told me about their cultures, and we exchanged cute accessories. It was memorable."

“我们的团队设计了带有熊猫和其他知名动物图案的徽章和贴纸。在比赛之前，我们与其他团队交流，并讨论了中国的地标和文化遗产。互动非常愉快，”张说。“每个团队都带来了自己的个性和热情。他们向我介绍了他们的文化，我们交换了可爱的配件。这是难忘的。”

Chinese team members frequently offered help to other teams in need. Wang Boquan, a 17-year-old from the Beijing No 4 High School, spoke of a touching episode that left him with a deep impression.

中国队成员经常向需要帮助的其他团队提供帮助。来自北京第四中学的17岁王博权讲述了一个给他留下深刻印象的感人事件。

"Due to visa issues, most members of Team Afghanistan couldn't make it. Only a 14-year-old girl, her mother and a mentor were able to attend. Since they needed four members — two drivers, a coach and a human player — I didn't hesitate to join as their human player, and modified the controls so that the girl could operate the robot alone," Wang says.

“由于签证问题，阿富汗队的大多数成员无法参加。只有一个14岁的女孩、她的母亲和一位导师能够出席。由于他们需要四名成员——两名驾驶员、一名教练和一名人类玩家——我毫不犹豫地加入了他们，成为他们人类玩家，并修改了控制方式，以便女孩可以独自操作机器人，”王说。

---

The day before the competition, judges found that Team Afghanistan's robot exceeded the size limit, and disassembled it. Since the girl lacked mechanical knowledge, the Chinese participants helped solve the problem, and reassembled the robot, making sure it could compete.

比赛前一天，裁判发现阿富汗队的机器人超过了尺寸限制，并进行了拆卸。由于女孩缺乏机械知识，中国参与者帮助解决了问题，并重新组装了机器人，确保它可以参加比赛。

---

Throughout the competition, Wang balanced helping the Afghan team with supporting his own. "In the final qualification match, Team China and Team Afghanistan were paired as teammates, with me joining Team Afghanistan. It was an unforgettable experience. I never thought I'd be competing representing two countries," Wang recalls.

在整个比赛中，王在帮助阿富汗队和支持自己的团队之间保持平衡。“在最后的资格赛中，中国队和阿富汗队被配对为队友，我加入了阿富汗队。这是一次难忘的经历。我从未想过会代表两个国家参加比赛，”王回忆道。

The Chinese team's mentor He Xuguo, who has been in charge of FIRST Global Challenge matches in China since 2017, was recognized with an Outstanding Mentor award. He says that he is more like a team member than a supervisor, and stresses the students' independence and innovation.

中国队的导师何学国，自2017年以来一直负责中国FIRST全球挑战赛的比赛，获得了杰出导师奖。他说，他更像是一个团队成员而不是监督者，并强调学生的独立性和创新。

"At first glance, the robot might seem beyond the capacity of high school students to make, but looking at their notes, you can see how it grew into its final form. Each subsystem went through at least four iterations," he says.

“乍一看，机器人似乎超出了高中生制造的能力，但看看他们的笔记，你可以看到它是如何成长为最终形态的。每个子系统至少经历了四次迭代，”他说。

---

In addition to the fundamental skills of robot design and construction, robotics contests are also a test of teamwork, empathy, creativity and originality.

除了机器人设计和建造的基本技能外，机器人竞赛也是团队合作、同理心、创造力和原创性的考验。

---

He says that it is essential to prioritize creativity over rigid instruction. While allowing the students to take ownership of their projects, he offers suggestions, assesses the feasibility of their ideas, and manages the schedule to help them realize their vision.

他说，必须优先考虑创造力而不是僵化的教学。在允许学生拥有他们的项目的同时，他提供建议，评估他们的想法的可行性，并管理时间表以帮助他们实现他们的愿景。

---

Outside the competition, the team remains committed to sharing their successful experience and to facilitating robotics activities.

在比赛之外，团队仍然致力于分享他们成功的经验和促进机器人活动。

---

"We open-sourced our robot's code and designs immediately after the competition, in the hopes of helping more teams engage in technological activities," He says.

“我们在比赛后立即开源了我们的机器人代码和设计，希望帮助更多的团队参与技术活动，”他说。

---

After returning to China, they have developed plans to help robotics clubs make progress, including creating and publishing tutorials on social media platforms, and reaching out to socially responsible companies to engage in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) activities.

回到中国后，他们制定了帮助机器人俱乐部取得进步的计划，包括在社交媒体平台上创建和发布教程，并与承担社会责任的公司接触，参与STEM（科学、技术、工程和数学）活动。

---

"Competing alongside teams from over 190 countries and regions allowed the students to see the world's disparities and the different levels of educational resources. Our students come from Beijing's premier schools and have access to exceptional educational opportunities, and this competition has broadened their horizons," He says.

“与来自190多个国家和地区的团队一起竞争，让学生看到了世界上的差异和不同水平的教育资源。我们的学生来自北京的顶级学校，拥有出色的教育机会，这次比赛拓宽了他们的视野，”何说。	

---

"As beneficiaries of China's initiative of promoting scientific literacy, our students now shoulder part of the responsibility of promoting technology education. We hope their influence will help mobilize more social resources to advance science and technology education across China."

“作为中国推广科学素养倡议的受益者，我们的学生现在承担了推广技术教育的部分责任。我们希望他们的影响力将有助于动员更多的社会资源，推动中国科学技术教育的发展。”

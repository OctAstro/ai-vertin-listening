Paper as a clothing fabric has unfolded new possibilities in the hands of Shanghai designers as 20 apparel designs made with paper stunned the world at the closing ceremony of the 47th World-Skills Competition in Lyon, France.

在上海设计师的手中，纸张作为一种服装面料展现出了新的可能性，因为在法国里昂举行的第47届世界技能大赛闭幕式上，20件用纸张制作的服装惊艳了世界。

Zhang Zufang, a 72-year-old professor at Donghua University in Shanghai, is the lead designer of this paper apparel.

72岁的张祖芳是东华大学上海分校的教授，也是这些纸质服装的首席设计师。

---

"I am extremely honored to present the results on such a meaningful occasion and the world stage. China is the birthplace of paper and I feel proud to show the world the strength, culture, techniques and innovation of our university, Shanghai and China," says Zhang.

“我非常荣幸能在这样一个有意义的场合和世界舞台上展示成果。中国是纸张的发源地，我感到自豪，能向世界展示我们大学、上海和中国的力量、文化、技术和创新，”张说。

Following China's triumph at the WorldSkills Lyon 2024 competition with 36 gold, nine silver and four bronze medals, Shanghai is set to host the 48th competition in 2026.

Chinese participants Lu Junwei and Xie Huiyuan earned the prestigious Albert Vidal Award, recognizing competitors with the highest overall points across all skill competitions.

中国参赛者陆俊伟和谢慧媛获得了享有盛誉的阿尔伯特·维达尔奖，该奖项表彰在所有技能竞赛中总分最高的参赛者。

Echoing the remarkable achievements the Chinese competitors reached, Zhang and her team presented an astonishing show on Sept 15 with exquisite paper apparel that the world had seldom seen before.

呼应中国参赛者取得的卓越成就，张和她的团队在9月15日呈现了一场令人惊叹的表演，展示了世界罕见的精美纸质服装。

With paper as the core and "invitation" as the concept, these pieces feature a blend of Chinese and Western cultural elements, as well as traditional and modern techniques, including sunmao (mortise-and-tenon) joints, paper cutting, paper folding, laser cutting, lanterns, church, pagodas, dragons, irises and the white magnolia — Shanghai's city flower.

以纸张为核心，以“邀请”为主题，这些作品融合了中西方文化元素以及传统与现代技术，包括榫卯（榫卯）结构、剪纸、折纸、激光切割、灯笼、教堂、宝塔、龙、鸢尾花和白玉兰——上海市花。

---

Zhang introduced that Tyvek eco-friendly paper and washable kraft paper are the main materials used, making them light, durable, waterproof, sustainable and environmentally friendly.

张介绍，主要使用了特卫强环保纸和可洗牛皮纸，使它们轻便、耐用、防水、可持续且环保。

---

Instead of using glue or sewing the pieces, Zhang's team skillfully chose traditional Chinese sunmao joints as the main method to make the clothing. Sunmao was often used in ancient Chinese architecture to connect materials without glue or nails. While different from wooden pieces, it has been challenging for the design team to implement the method.

张的团队没有使用胶水或缝制这些作品，而是巧妙地选择了中国传统的榫卯结构作为制作服装的主要方法。榫卯在古代中国建筑中常用于连接材料，无需胶水或钉子。虽然与木件不同，但对设计团队来说，实施这种方法一直是一个挑战。

---

"We made several experiments and adjustments to the techniques we used in making the apparel. Sunmao has many advantages as it is very flexible. With paper pieces of various materials and shapes, we could join them to make plain and three-dimensional creations, so they look light and beautiful," Zhang explains, adding that one piece of a paper dress can be the joint of hundreds of smaller pieces.

“我们对制作服装的技术进行了多次实验和调整。榫卯有许多优点，它非常灵活。有了各种材料和形状的纸张，我们可以将它们连接起来，制作出平面和立体的作品，使它们看起来轻盈美观，”张解释道，并补充说，一件纸质连衣裙可以是数百个较小部件的连接点。

---

This is not Zhang's first attempt to make paper clothing. In 2013, she was invited to create several paper garments for TV hosts at Shanghai Media Group. However, Zhang still met many new challenges in completing the task.

这并不是张第一次尝试制作纸质服装。2013年，她被邀请为上海传媒集团的电视主持人制作几件纸质服装。然而，张在完成这次任务时还是遇到了许多新挑战。

---

"Unlike the case in 2013, the paper apparel we made this time is not static, as the models are set to walk, run, dance and perform at the ceremony rather than standing still and posing. The biggest challenge this time was to protect the shape and form of the clothing throughout long-distance transportation because paper wrinkles easily and cannot be ironed," says Zhang.

“与2013年的情况不同，我们这次制作的纸质服装不是静态的，因为模特将在仪式上行走、奔跑、跳舞和表演，而不是静止站立和摆姿势。这次最大的挑战是在长途运输过程中保护服装的形状和形态，因为纸张容易起皱，不能熨烫，”张说。

---

Zhang's team comprises over 50 teachers and students from the College of Fashion and Design at Donghua University and the School of Design and Innovation at the China Academy of Art. Assigned this task in late May, the team managed to produce 22 sets of paper apparel and 10 sets of non-paper futuristic clothing for the closing ceremony.

张的团队由东华大学时尚与设计学院和中国美术学院设计与创新学院的50多名教师和学生组成。该团队在5月底接到任务后，设法为闭幕式制作了22套纸质服装和10套非纸质的未来主义服装。

---

The team's efforts and hard work over three months paid off in Lyon. The show not only impressed global audiences but also motivated Zhang's team.

该团队在里昂的三个月的努力和辛勤工作得到了回报。这场表演不仅给全球观众留下了深刻印象，也激励了张的团队。

---

"I am honored to represent Shanghai and my country to participate in the world-class event, to show the charm of China's younger generation on a world stage. I am very excited and proud," said Xia Kunpeng, an undergraduate student majoring in costume design and performance at Donghua University, after the performance.

“我很荣幸能代表上海和我的国家参加世界级的活动，在世界舞台上展示中国年轻一代的魅力。我非常兴奋和自豪，”东华大学服装设计与表演专业的本科生夏昆鹏在表演后说。

---

Zhang, as the team's leader and a veteran in the industry for over four decades, is geared up again for her future.

作为团队的领导者和行业资深人士，张已经为未来做好了准备，她在这个领域工作了四十多年。

---

"With the application of sunmao in the paper clothing, we are paying tribute to ancient Chinese wisdom and techniques. I believe the best way to pay our respects is to inherit and innovate," says Zhang.

“通过在纸质服装中应用榫卯，我们正在向中国古代的智慧和技术致敬。我相信最好的致敬方式是继承和创新，”张说。

---

"Hopefully, we can roll out our experience to the public. I would be more than pleased to share about sunmao and promote traditional Chinese culture to more people."

“希望我们能将我们的经验推广给公众。我非常乐意分享关于榫卯的知识，并促进传统中国文化的传播。”

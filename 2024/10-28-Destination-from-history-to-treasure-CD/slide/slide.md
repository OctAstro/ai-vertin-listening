Greater number of tourists are discovering the charms and architecture of ancient Zhengding, reports Zhang Yu in Shijiazhuang.

越来越多的游客正在发现古城正定的魅力和建筑，张宇在石家庄报道。

One day as the sun was setting in April 1933, Liang Sicheng (1901-72), the architect, architectural historian and educator, also known as the "father of modern Chinese architecture", arrived at Zhengding Railway Station by train from Beijing. The journey was the beginning of his exploration of the ancient county of Zhengding in Shijiazhuang, Hebei province.

1933年4月的一个日落时分，梁思成（1901-1972），这位建筑师、建筑历史学家和教育家，也被誉为“现代中国建筑之父”，乘火车从北京抵达正定火车站。这次旅程标志着他对位于河北省石家庄的古城正定的探索开始。

---

"I was struck by the grandeur of Zhengding within minutes of arriving, which came as a surprise to me. However, at the time, I was unaware that amid the densely packed houses there were many treasures waiting to be discovered," Liang was quoted as saying in Pindu Zhengding ("savoring Zhengding"), a book by Sun Wanyong, a former Party secretary of the county.

梁思成在孙万勇的书《品味正定》中被引用说：“我一到达正定，几分钟内就被其宏伟所震撼，这让我感到惊讶。然而，当时我并不知道，在那些密集的房屋之中，有许多宝藏等待着被发现。”孙万勇是该县的前党委书记。

Located about 250 kilometers southwest of central Beijing, the ancient county that took Liang 10 hours to reach in the 1930s sits beside the Hutuo River in the northern part of Shijiazhuang city.

正定位于北京市中心西南约250公里处，这座城市在梁思成1930年代需要10小时才能到达，它坐落在石家庄市北部的滹沱河畔。

With a long and impressive history, Zhengding was designated a national historical and cultural city by the State Council in 1994.

Within the small historical county, which covers less than 10 square kilometers, there are dozens of ancient structures, including 10 national-level key cultural heritage protection units, five provincial-level cultural protection units, and more than 7,600 cultural artifacts in the local museum collection. Today, 38 ancient buildings still exist in the county seat.

在这个面积不到10平方公里的小历史县内，有数十个古建筑，包括10个国家级重点文物保护单位，5个省级文化保护单位，以及当地博物馆收藏的7600多件文物。今天，县城中仍有38座古建筑存在。

Zhengding was mainly known for its "nine towers, four pagodas, and eight major temples, along with 24 ornamental archways", evidence of its abundance of famous historical sites dating back to as early as the Sui Dynasty (581-618).

Among them, Liang referred to Longxing Temple as one of the most well-known temples outside Beijing. Built in 586, it is one of the earliest and largest well-preserved Buddhist temples in China, and it left a deep impression on him.

其中，梁思成提到隆兴寺是北京以外最知名的寺庙之一。隆兴寺建于586年，是中国最早和最大的保存完好的佛教寺庙之一，给他留下了深刻的印象。

在他对古代建筑的后续研究中，他多次提到隆兴寺是“辉煌的”、“宏伟的”和“深奥的”，根据孙万勇的说法。

"It has the only surviving revolving Buddhist scripture bookcase from the 10th century in China. The structure of the bookcase pavilion is particularly exquisite, a masterpiece of wooden architecture. … It made us ecstatic, and happily thrilled," Liang was quoted as saying, upon seeing the Zhuanlunzang Ge, or revolving bookcase pavilion, at Longxing Temple. The quote is recorded in Sun's book.

梁思成在看到隆兴寺的转轮藏阁（Zhuanlunzang Ge）或旋转经书阁时说：“它是中国唯一现存的10世纪的旋转佛教经书阁。经书阁的结构特别精致，是木结构建筑的杰作……它让我们兴奋不已，非常激动。”这句话记录在孙万勇的书中。

---

Liang was also surprised by the temple's other treasures, including the Moni Dian, or Hall of Manichaean, from the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127) period, in which there's another treasure — a multicolored statue of Avalokitesvara (Guanyin).

梁思成还对寺庙的其他宝藏感到惊讶，包括北宋时期（960-1127年）的摩尼殿，里面有另一件宝藏——一尊多彩的观音雕像。

---

The statue, in a sitting posture, wears a crown, draped in ornaments. One foot rests on a lotus, while the other rests on the thigh. Both hands are placed naturally on the knee, exuding a sense of tranquillity. The statue breaks with the stiffness often associated with religious images, and embodies a more natural and graceful presence.

这尊雕像呈坐姿，头戴皇冠，装饰华丽。一只脚放在莲花上，另一只脚放在大腿上。双手自然地放在膝盖上，散发出一种宁静感。雕像打破了通常与宗教图像相关的僵硬感，展现出更自然和优雅的气质。

The Lingxiao pagoda, a brick-and-wood hybrid tower in neighboring Tianning Temple that is built in the form of an octagonal pavilion-style structure and is 40.98 meters high, and the Xumi (or Sumeru) pagoda, built in 636 of the Tang Dynasty at the Kaiyuan Temple, also caught Liang's eye.

位于邻近天宁寺的灵霄塔，是一座砖木混合结构的塔，呈八角亭式结构，高40.98米，以及建于唐朝636年的须弥（或苏美）塔，也引起了梁思成的注意。

---

After this initial journey, Liang found himself drawn repeatedly to Zhengding by these treasures and visited many buildings again on several occasions, measuring, photographing and even discovering new buildings, according to records.

在这次初步旅程之后，梁思成发现自己被这些宝藏所吸引，多次回访正定，测量、拍照，甚至发现新建筑，根据记录。

For Li Nan, a 36-year-old tourist from Beijing, Zhengding was the best weekend choice for her family on Oct 12 and 13.Unlike Liang, who took 10 hours to get to Zhengding in the 1930s, Li's train journey took just over an hour.

"The first day, we traveled to the county by high-speed train, and then visited many scenic spots, such as the Longxing Temple, and Rong Mansion," Li says, talking about the trip she and her family of four took.

Her itinerary is typical of a one-day tour of Zhengding. Rong Mansion, or Rongguo Fu is a group of buildings built in the 1980s in the style of the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368-1911), and is based on the classical novel Dream of the Red Chamber by Qingera writer Cao Xueqin.

"The food was delicious, while the ancient buildings were magnificent, but you can only get to know them better if you go with a guide, who can tell you details and stories about the old buildings," she says.

“食物很美味，古建筑很宏伟，但只有跟随导游，你才能更好地了解它们，导游可以告诉你关于古老建筑的细节和故事，”她说。

在正定的第二天，这家人参观了其他寺庙。“旅程很短，但文化很深。我们非常欣赏，”李说。
